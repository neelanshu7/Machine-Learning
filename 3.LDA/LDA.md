Definition:<br>
LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique used primarily for classification. It projects data in a way that maximizes class separability.

Steps:<br>
  Compute the mean vectors for each class<br>
  Compute the within-class and between-class scatter matrices<br>
  Maximize the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance

Use Case:<br>
Face recognition, gene expression analysis.
