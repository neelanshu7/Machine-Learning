1. Apply Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a data set.
2. Apply Principal Component Analysis on a high dimensional data set to reduce dimension.
3. Implement and study a non-parametric technique namely, k- Nearest Neighbour classifier on a given data set.
4. Apply Linear Regression technique on prediction data sets.
