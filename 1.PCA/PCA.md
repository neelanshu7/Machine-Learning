Definition:<br>
  PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system to reduce redundancy and emphasize variation.

How it works:<br>
  Identifies principal components (uncorrelated axes)<br>
  Projects data into these components<br>
  Retains only the top components explaining most variance<br>

Use Case:<br>
  High-dimensional data visualization, noise reduction, preprocessing before clustering or classification.
